   If you click on the arrow that is facing down right next to .streamlit in the left side bar menu and you see the file config.toml:
   Please fo to your files in your computer and take out the config.toml file out of the .streamlit folder. You can copy it and paste it somewhere else (just make sure you remember where you are placing it so after running the app from your computer you can put it back to the .streamlit folder), then go back to the .streamlit folder and remove the config.toml file.
2. Go back to your Visual Studio Code app and click one more time on the  .streamlit file that pops out in the left side bar of the window to confirm that the config.toml file
   got removed effectively. (It shouldn't show anything)
   Once the config.toml file have been removed from the .streamlit folder, you can do the following steps:
   * Click on Terminal (It's at the topleft menu)
   * Click on New Terminal

     In that screen:
     - Click on launch profile (The arrow facing down at the top right menu)
     - Click on Git Bash (Let it load a few seconds)
     - Type on the Terminal right next to the $ symbol the line: streamlit run app.py
     - After that, you'll see the message:
